# Java Franchise Management System

This Java project demonstrates the use of abstract classes, inheritance, and dynamic method binding through a franchise management system. It includes two franchise implementations ‚Äî KFC and Porches ‚Äî where each subclass overrides the abstract methods defined in the base class FrinchiseApp. The program dynamically displays owner and location details using class introspection, making it scalable for any new brand.

Key OOP Concepts Used:
- Abstract classes
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism
- Dynamic branding using getClass().getSimpleName()

Franchise owners and locations are managed via constructor injection, and the system simulates operations like showing menus, taking orders, and calculating daily revenue.

## üí° Features

- Abstract class implementation (`FrinchiseApp`)
- Subclasses: `KFC` and `Porches`
- Displays franchise owner and location dynamically
- Uses polymorphism and method overriding
- Simple console-based simulation
